(old poem.. Yesterday's thoughts) 

We stood out along the sides of the giant column as the train pulled into the station
people sang The Battle Hymn
To themselves in a low voice 
That harmonized
Or was the hum of a train in a tunnel,
... who knows? 
Obscene metallic, notions
Of futures, schisms 
Guttural drones

And we, being cheeky,
juxtaposed kicked cans 
Of change and Grim(m)'s 
Fairy Shepard hope

We sang John Brown's Body
Laughing all the way home

But still, Seeing that, 
We go to the movies on Wednesdays to escape ourselves
Wanting time to go without really knowing of it
letting yesterday's thoughts drip into the kitchen sink 
And congeal, it does so 
slowly into impressions of us
...
and we burn for the art of tomorrow.
