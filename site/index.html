<p>This is the beginning of my site. I'm figuring this out as I go, as I've always done with everything.</p>

<p>I keep thinking of Koyaanisqatsi. If you haven't seen it, you should. I keep thinking about this quote from its wikipedia page:</p>

<p>Reggio explains the lack of dialogue by stating "it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live." In the Hopi language, the word Koyaanisqatsi means "unbalanced life".</p>
<p>English is the only tool I've ever learned for expressing my ideas semantically to the humans around me, and it's insufficient. With music, acting, coding, etc (i.e. my creative passions) I have tools for expressing my feelings artistically, but that's insufficient for practical communication. I need better tools. It has only recently snapped together in my mind that I am a computer expert and software developer, and the power is in my hands to create whatever tools I want.</p>
<p>My idea is this: I'm going to get rid of the bullshit so we can think. That's a we as in me and you (because I know you're dealing with the same bullshit I am), but also a "we" as in "humanity".</p>
<p>All computers suck, and they suck because of capitalism. I'm starting a non-profit for the purpose of developing computing software and hardware for people with attention issues (most people), to help people communicate, to help people be productive.</p>
<p>This is going to be a long project. I'm just beginning the R&D I need to do. I think that there's a real need for this. I've realized that almost no one knows how the hell to use a computer and people are increasingly becoming afraid of their machines. Those who aren't are still stuck in unproductive patterns because they've been trained to think that they can't learn how to become an expert at using a computer. They're wrong. The problem isn't them -- Capitalism trains you to think the problem is in you by its very nature.</p>
<p>The problem is Microsoft and Apple's business models. They were successful in the market initially because they were able to bridge a gap that needed to be bridged -- they were able to get computers into people's hands, and get people to use them. The problem is how they solved that problem, and thus how they've inextricably formed their business models -- Microsoft and Apple both make money by convincing people to let them deliver a pre-packaged, proprietary computing experience. Microsoft is just a software company, so they have to work with a million hardware companies, so that's why windows is so schizoid. Apple has the luxury of full control of their platform, and that's why macs are beautiful and just pleasant to use.</p>
<p>They're both terrible operating systems from a usability perspective once you try to start doing anything complicated, tho. Anything you might want to do requires you pay money for some complicated proprietary software that is nearly guranteed to be quirky as fuck and to impose its own ideas of how you should work upon you.</p>
<p>I am looking for people who are dissatisfied with their phones and / or computers to help me figure what software I need to make, what gaps need to be filled, etc. If you're in school for something not closely connected to computing (e.g. comp sci, ee, etc), you're not ready to join in on the work directly, because fucking around with this kind of DIY computer junk while you're desperately trying to keep up with classes is hard as shit (trust me I know from experience). But that's not the only way you can help out if you think this project is something you want to be involved in.</p>
<p>One of the pieces of software I've already gotten the idea to write (but I haven't actually done the R&D / design for yet) is what I've been calling "postzine" (you know i'm serious because I shelled out 75Â¢ for the domain). I was thinking about how social networks are inadequate for my communication needs, and I was thinking about how underground radical publishing is still stuck on 'zines, and it suddenly came to me that the solution to the problem is the combination of the two. "Postzine" is the combination of "post" as in "after" (the successor to) zines, and it's also "post" as in "posting online" or "the postal service". Basically, I'm making a website, and I'm looking for cool / awesome / beautiful / creative people to make wonderful things on it.</p>
<p>The problem is that all existing web publishing platforms were made primarily by software developers. What needs to happen is we (as in whoever ends up joining me in this project, already got a couple folks aboard) need to create a platform from the ground up that supports all the dream features the modern, "digital native" might want in a publishing platform. The problem is, I can't make it alone -- because what I've realized is that I have no fuckin clue what other people are seeing when they look at a computer. What i see and what other people see is quite different -- it's always been different, but it was never obvious enough for me to realize it until I became a computer expert shut-in living in a feminist collective (we call ourselves Alpha-Alpha-Alpha, or tri-alph).</p>
<p>See like.</p>
<p>I'm not neurotypical. I don't know what I am. No one knows what I am. I was diagnosed with ADHD but I'm pretty sure that's not a real thing, it's just something the medical establishment came up with to try to explain the confusing phenomenon of an epidemic of people not being able to function in society. The problem was never US, though, the problem is the system -- We are surrounded by a terrifying, meaningless society where everything is trying to simultaneously pump us up, convince us we're living in the best of all possible worlds, and consume our souls and run us ragged.</p>
<p>English is an insufficient tool. It's just the bullshit we (as in humanity) ended up being left with after the british fucked the world, anyway. It's clear to me the tool we need does not yet exist, but it's also clear to me that it's possible for things to be better if we can just learn to communicate better. And that means the utter and complete destruction of advertising. I think it can be done, because I think there's enough of us cowering in fear, searching for some way out of this Kafkaesque nightmare reality.</p>

They want your soul. Don't give it to them.
