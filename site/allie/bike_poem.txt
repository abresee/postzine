I hope you understand, fellow cyclist,
standing still, balanced precariously
as you fight your own inertia
to take off after the light turns
at Berkeley and Commonwealth,

that when I passed you
so quickly, so obviously laboring 
to move as quickly as my beat-up bike,
in need of a tune-up,
and my still soft body,
playing catch-up after too many hours 
in front of a computer,
could possibly take me,

It was to ensure you'd have 
all the room you needed
to travel whatever pace 
seemed most comfortable.

I have on occasion been a
water molecule in a fluid flow of
automobile traffic
When you're a molecule, you're
hemmed in on all sides, your 
motion restricted by the 
environment made up of other
anonymous gas-guzzling
molecules from japan, or germany,
or detroit.

The pipes of the streets at least
grant some choice at junctures,
though in a life of gray routine,
to work, to school, to home
(or more likely, the liquor store first),
this microscopic agency shrinks to nothing.

Now that I have escaped
from that prison of steel and glass
and shitty talk radio,
I take my freedom seriously.

The city of boston and God-King
Menino have deigned to grant us
dedicated lanes in which to
stretch our neglected limbs,
to feel at least a grain of the freedom
of motion we are normally denied, and
since this freedom is so precious,
I make sure to share it with my fellow-
cyclists as fairly as possible.

I know I might look different,
might look like someone showing off
someone with my apparent gender 
attempting to demonstrate superiority
to someone of yours.

There might've been a time, where
(though if it weren't for the lack 
of an address I've have this gender
on an eternal return to sender)
I'd've wrapped myself in that privilege,
that perception, that misinterpretation,
and depart, hidden, performing a role
to hide from even myself my true intentions

but that's not me, and can't be me
and now that I know, I hope you do to
I hope we can pedal together and be free.
