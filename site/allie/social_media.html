  <h1>A Modern Materialist Analysis of Social Media</h1>

  <h1>Abstract:</h1>
  <p>
  The Internet is haunted by a specter, an unnamable beast, once called "freedom", another time "chaos", recently called "Communism", now laid bare in a panoptical spectacle with no director. This is the specter known now (in at the northeast, 'round here, I reckon), as Anarchism.
  </p>

  When the economically and socially "modern" thoughtful American, equipped with smartphone, tablet, laptop, and (luck prevailing, desktop) sits down to write her screeds against the unfolding global disaster, she has before her a veritable "garden of earthly delights" from which to choose. The web communications channel, what was once MySpace, Freindster, LiveJournal, has transmuted to the present as facebook, tumblr, and twitter. Selecting carefully, she weaves her story to be submitted to "Feministing", or is it "Jezebel"? I've seen some of us on "Suicide Girls", resolutely blogging intelligent analyses that no one but a close few friends and clients will see.

  <p>"So it goes", said the Vonnegut lover, with the tattoo of the sphincter on her wrist.</p>
  <p>"Who is John Galt", I said once, in a mocking hatred of the shrugging globe from whence it came.</p>
  <p>"The 'ghost in the shell', the zeitgeist, can never be named", the spectacle continues unabated. With only a "But..." can we end those dreams that give us pause by naming the enemies that circle.</p>
  <p>The material channels through which information flows in the modern mass media are ill defined, relying on a semi-mystical awareness of there being "the Internet", or perhaps, "the Web". The more "in-tune" are aware of "memes" but perhaps do not get the point. The crux of modernity in the age of the web is fans of Orwell creating little IngSoc-es and their own private "Newspeak"s.</p>
  <p>An analysis can be performed of the existing radio, fiber, and co-axial networks that deliver TV and Radio news, correlating the delivery of different news stories with events that occur. This is standard practice in comparative media studies of any kind. In general, though, this practice is not as often extended to a direct materialist philosophical analysis of the technology underpinning the communications themselves. That is, deep analysis of how the limitations of the broadcast channel itself cuts off frequencies of sound or light, or imposes literal grids, or rasters, on the display, is rarely performed. Examples of such deconstructions can be found in the critical theorists, but the average American has no access to the works of Zizek, to put it lightly.</p>
  <p>A modern materialist analysis of social media must rely on a direct dissection of the technologies that spin the web. As myriad independent media outlets spray unfiltered, uncited content wantonly into the media sea, it is only through direct comparison of the different "sharing" functionality (the various 'tweets', 'retweets', 'plus one's and 'facebook posts') that a modern material understanding of social media can be formed. What proceeds is a direct analysis of the technological underpinnings of the web, their historical roots,  the motivations of the various standards bodies that create these technologies, and its social implications as the modern media drama unfolds.</p>
  <h2>1. Wither Anarchism (cf. Bookchin)?</h2>
  <h3> "There is no force which can hold back the irreverence of the net when someone is attempting to be serious about something." - @NotJohnFord </h3>
<p>
Anarchism is an ill-defined ideology. In North America, Anarchism has three main intellectual forbears: Labor-Anarchism (with Berkman and Goldman as banner-bearers), Social-Anarchism (with British punk rockers "Crass" locked in timeless struggle with the likes of Bookchin), and the form most visible in recent years, Anonymous.

      <p>"First,  I define 'neo-anarchism' as the various libertarian socialist/autonomous Marxist/ancom ideals emerging after the collapse of the East Block in response to globalization and neoliberal commercialization. They have important differences between them, but are generally defined by</p>
      <ol><li>the idea that we live in a 'New' period of Capitalism, that, for reasons they consider significant enough, needs to be 're-theorized' a la Hardt and Negri and other less Marxist authors</li>
        <li>the idea that this new theory needs a distinctly new practice (which tends to become merely a repackaged version of Kropotkinite localism)</li>
        <li>a series of buzzwords that is supposed to define it (e.g. "horizontalism", "communization", and last but not least "autonomous")</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In this school of thought, 'Autonomy' becomes simultaneously the only non-oppressive worker politics and the only sociologically effective way of organizing, depending on who you're debating. The person doubting autonomy is labelled an 'anti-worker elitist' or perhaps a divergent intellectual who just doesn't get this 'correct' sociological theory du jour. In this system, as worker power spontaneously emerges, loosely federated groups of workers connect in ill specified ways, naturalistically avoiding 'bad authority'. This system of thought rarely explores issues of critical importance, such as the feedback loop between the 'top' and 'bottom', and there's generally little distinction drawn between 'Autonomia' and bourgeios centralistic democracy. Autonomous local workers are expected to be able to solve complex macro-issues using organizational structures that by necessity function as economistic entities (and questions about the material channels through which trans-communal worker solidarity shall be built are anathema.) The global working class is de-emphasized in favor of the individual workers, but while ideological lip service is paid to sustainable industry, logistical concerns about how this is achieved remain continually unanswered. Thus, despite idealistic conceptions of the Soviets during the Russian Revolution, they did not function as 'autonomous communes' in the modern sense. Lenin might say that these geographical expressions of worker-power were important for revolutionary development, but that they were not ends in themselves as global contradictions take primacy over the local." - @sushi_goat, <i>Comments on 'Autonomia'</i>

       Unfortunately, for many communities, the only effective method of enforcement of the ettiquite of discussion (what in less immediate forms of online communication is called 'nettiquette') is to moderate discussion without recourse to the contributor. Individuals who see themselves as simply asking questions with no understanding of how they are being percieved as a group are often outraged, or depressed, to find themselves silenced in discussion. The practice of "Banning" has meaning on old-net communication systems (such as BBS, fora, or USENET-style email lists), but in modern "social media" communications, there is not a well-defined conception of "place" for people to be banned from. To wit: anyone can form a "group" online, and whenever there exists a clique with no defined ways of resolving conflict, any attempts to end (potentially seriously violent) conflicts tend towards the vigilante.

2. Facebook **in progress #feminism #derailing**
</h2>
<p>
Because of the nature of facebook's privacy infrastructure, it is impossible to know if one is seeing all sides of the discussion as it actually unfolds. "Derailing", as a concept, is inherently problematic through social media communication channels -- that is, without a pre-established set of social mores of discussion or even an understanding of who may be participating in the discussion, it is simultaneously impossible to NOT de-rail AND ALSO to prevent de-railment itself. This train ain't got no fukkin engineer, we just go hard.
