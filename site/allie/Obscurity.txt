"When are we actually going to do something?" said Kat. She was looking with impatience at Daniel when I answered.
"I know a pizza place down the street! They do half-price pitchers and have ridiculous live music on saturdays even!". I can't help but feel like I'm being a tad overeager.
Kat rolled her eyes. "We've been eating out a lot recently. Can't we go somewhere more exciting?" She turned to Daniel who seemed to be mesmerized by the Ron Paul '08 blog he was currently absorbing, the light of his CRT monitor highlighting a week's stubble. "Hm?" he said.
"I think I'm going to leave, but you guys have fun". I tried to keep my voice from quavering. This is what being friends is like, isn't it?

"Allie. I need you to be here and pay attention if you're going to be part of this action". We were somewhere in manhattan, near the financial district, trying desperately to impede the flow of Capital, exactly one year after Occupy Wall Street began. It wasn't going well.
"YEAH Okay, I was just thinking". I adjusted my black bandana. "Ready when you are?" I wasn't thinking about anything Ariel was saying, but going over memories of the previous two days with Emily with a fine-toothed comb. What had any of it meant? She was rolling with a different affinity group, an unnamed coalition of folks with only one person I considered a comrade. I hoped she was okay.

"WAR MACHINE!" I shouted, and the reply came back from first a handful, and then more and more. "TEAR IT DOWN!!". We blocked the intersection until we saw blue helmets approach. "RAINBOW RAINBOW" I shouted, the signal to disperse. I stuck with two affinity group members as we weaved through the streets, figuring out where to go next. What were we doing here? Why did I come?

****

Their head cracked against my knee. That's all I remember first-hand, but in the coming weeks, I saw video of it surface. Emily and I held up banners in the shadow of the still incomplete One World Trade Center tower, giving some privacy as the street medic treated my comrade. I'd grabbed them immediately, pulled them out of the street, and handed them off to Ariel while I made sure the 3rd banner-bearer was physically okay. He got arrested, but not beaten. 

On the bus ride back, my comrade said to me "Allie... Did you help me earlier?". Having suffered head injuries myself, I was even more disturbed at this point. "Yeah, you don't remember?"

****

I lost my house. Moved in a flash from Allston to Dorchester. At least it was a house full of comrades...

****

"What? No you didn't help Drake." Ariel argued with me. "I got them to the medic. You were off doing something else." Our affinity group, as loose as it had always been, was falling apart.

****

"Katia" I typed, rolling the word around on my tongue. "Is that your real name?"

"Yeah. Why?"

"Oh sorry nothing. It's just, that name has a lot of meaning for me"

****

"So, when are we doing something again?" Stephi said semi impatiently. I knew it wasn't really impatience, just hypervigilance.

"We're meeting Emma for sushi, remember? She's gluten free, so there's not a lot of options.

"right! Emma is your lesbian girlfriend?" I couldn't tell if she was being glib or sincere.

"Um well. She *has* identified as a lesbian, but when I told her I felt like she was my girlfriend, her reply was just 'Well, That seems valid..." and I didn't really know what that meant.

"Oh. Right."

The orange line rumbled by as we approached it on foot. Malden is too small for us.

"I'm a fellow worker, too" She said. She held up her red card. Unlike mine, it was embossed gold lettering rather than cheap black ink. I was overly aware of how my hoodie was falling apart and felt for the first time since high school like I was "out of uniform".

I realize she's been sending messages for a bit and look back at the IM window. "Is everything okay?" she says

"No. No it isn't" This outburst is unfair to her. I don't know anyone, especially myself. "I'm sorry, we just need to stop talking. Everything here is too fucked up, I can't deal with another goat. Too many black cats, too many animals, too many workers, too many guns" I cover my eyes and ears even though no one can see or hear me anyway, even though I'm alone in my room.

"I'm just worried about you. You don't need to yell."

"It's all I know how to do, okay??" Ariel isn't responding at all to my attempts to process the way she's been treating me. Why am I doing this? Obscurity has nothing to do with these other situations, she's from the other side of the god damned globe. My brain is falling apart.

I grip the plunger and push. Estrogen, intramuscular. What can this possibly change? Nothing, Nothing, Nothing, NOTHING --
