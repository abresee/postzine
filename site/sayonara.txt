An instant passes, looking at your face
a moment lasting for the rest of time
stretching till it far exceeds my grasp
my mind forsaking all my thinking's trust
emotion that I cannot think to fake;
A triumph of my broken satyr's lie

Remembering moments when I sought to lie
dizzy, with a drunkard's plastic face,
to give to you a friendship I could fake.
Happy then, but memory shows in time!
I never was somebody you could trust,
never gave you friendship you could grasp.

My joke, my laugh, my distance there to grasp
But if I straighten up and drop the lie:
I know I'm naught but trouble. You can trust:
Only through these stanzas can I face
the gulf that spreads unending across time
between friends and the me I tried to fake

I treated you like nothing, tried to fake
resentment; but what I failed to grasp,
something that I do all the time,
My self righteous anger was a lie:
A sham so that I wouldn't have to face
my hostile self that drove away your trust

I'm the kind of guy who wants to trust
but I know myself too well, so I just fake
a smile, a joke perched on my face
You know what I always failed to grasp
Friendship can't be bought with just a lie
A lesson that I never learned in time

You're a symbol of my wasted time:
My sorrow is that I can never trust
myself to keep repairing what my lie
has broken, what I've gotten from my fake
Companionship; You exceed my grasp.
I don't know how I can ever face

Your smile, my lie, incessant marching time
Your face in pictures; I can never trust
to grasp to stop my harmful fake
