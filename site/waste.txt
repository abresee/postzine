I can't explain the bulging of my weight
and can't recall the purpose of my spine
the rumble starts; a gurling in my gut;
This year decays no slower than the last
like week-old food reminds you of the new;
My fattened hunger never to be gone

I rise and move like syrup til I've gone
a ways towards drawing closer to the weight
of sorrow'd thoughts of life begun: a new
dawn here to bring the strain off of my spine
"this corpulent addiction shall not last"
this thought a laugh that bounces in my gut.

And made of flesh, and housed beneath my guy
a hateful pustule mocking times I've gone
to where my final fantasies could last
as always: numbers measuring the weight
of wasted years to atrophy my spine
a spiteful random flashes shouting "new

comforts for your addled mind. And new
confections for your aging infant gut
Just press a button to rip out his spine
and then your daily troubles will be gone
Pretend, for now, that you have shed the weight
And, jealous, guard the feeling to the last

moment. Suckle at the tear, your last
raw gasp at childhood's worn-out natal new."
A joke? once heard, I can't dislodge the weight
of rancid mellow saffron in my guy,
of underneath the rotten pizza, gone
the days when worn and cracked would read the spine

of tomes that would send shivers down my spine
and glow the joy of thought: premiere the last
and echo fading and the feeling's gone,
and nothing else devoted to the new
No Novel Structure!! something in my gut
tells me that my brain once pulled my weight

But days are gone when I kept my spine straight
and now at last I crumble at the weight
of worthless moments, withered, in my gut.
